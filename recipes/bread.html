        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This Bread is a German specialty, mostly eaten for Breakfast.</p>
        <p>It takes around <strong>15 Minutes</strong> to prepair and needs an <strong>overnight resttime.</strong></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600g rye or spelled flour</li>
            <li>340g 35-40°C warm water <em>(optimal temperatur for yeast)</em></li>
            <li>20g yeast</li>
            <li>3-4 tsp. of salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp. of sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the sugar and water, then crumble in the yeast and let it sit for upto 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Put the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the water mixture. Work the water into the flour.</li>
            <li>Only if nicely worked together add the salt and knead it for about two minutes</li>
            <li>Know put the bowl into the fridge and let the dough rest <b>overnight</b></li>
            <li>The next day take it out and let rest at a warm place for about half an hour. Then form little boals out of the dough and place them on a baking tray. <em>Protip: Use a knife to cut little lines into the top of the boals.</em> Now let it rest for another hour in a warm place.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C and put a deep empty baking tray on the bottom of the oven</li>
            <li>Now boil some water. Put some of it on the bottom baking tray and if it vaporises you can fill all of your boiling water in it. This means the oven is ready and you can put in your tray with the bread. <em>We put in water to make sure the bread gets a nice crust put doesn't turn out to dry.</em></li>
            <li>Leave it in the oven for about 20 minutes and your done.</li>
        </ol>
